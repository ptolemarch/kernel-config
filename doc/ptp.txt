Precision Time Protocol

Some sort of neat time thingy? I dunno. Looks cool.

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Chrony_with_hardware_timestamping#Verifying_the_NIC_PTP_device_clock

Here's where it's defined:

	Symbol: PTP_1588_CLOCK [=y]
	Type  : tristate
	Prompt: PTP clock support
	  Location:
	    -> Device Drivers
	      -> PTP clock support
	  Defined at drivers/ptp/Kconfig:7

Possibly my network card has support for PTP via "Software Timestamping"?
