System76 Oryx Pro 3 (purchased early 2017)

Might essentially be a Clevo P650HS-G

  If so, also similar to:
  - Sager NP8157
  - Tuxedo XC1507v2

Also very similar to Clevo P650HP6, but that has an nVidia GeForce GTX1060

Processor is an Intel Core i7-7820HK @ 2.9GHz (Kaby Lake)
  Kaby Lake
  Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 9
    Extended Family 0
             Family 0x6
    Extended Model  0x9
             Model  0xE
    Stepping        0x9

I keep wondering whether I have LPSS (Low Power Subsystem). I don't. I know
this because apparently `lspci` would be fairly clear about it, if I did:

I figure this probably means I don't need CONFIG_INTEL_IDMA64 (and therefore
also not CONFIG_DMADEVICES).
